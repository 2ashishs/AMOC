About:
	AMOC 2011 is an International Conference to be held at IIT Roorkee, India. Since I was given the task
to design the website for the event, I checked out many conference website designs. Then I came accross
a free web template, which I modified according to the needs of the conference. It just turned out to be
quite exciting so I decided to share. Enjoy !!

Structure:
	-common
		Contains the php files which define the stucture of each page of the website. doctype-and-head contains the header part. nav-and-title contains the navigation menu, add or remove pages from the list. footer contains the footer information at the bottom of the page.
	-css
		Contains the style.css file which specifies style of various elements on the webpage.
	-Other folders and files are self explanatory.
